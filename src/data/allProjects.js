We were appointed to design the interior spaces of the house. The main concept behind the design was to create a modern, functional interior, elegant and at the same time simple to celebrate and give emphasis to the views towards the lake and the city. The wall facing the lake, was painted dark brown like the frames of the windows in order not to abstract the eye and give emphasis to the views. ",

Overlooking the double height space, a custom-made desk was created. To illuminate the space we designed a pendant lamp composed by a series of led strips hung in different lengths. The dominant material in the space is wood which, in combination with a palette of light colors creates a warm and relaxing environment for the residents."

The main concept behind this project was to merge modern elements with the existing rustic style of the house and surrounding context and create a warm, welcoming and relaxing environment for its residents. The house is developed in two levels and consists of 2 large bedrooms, 1 guestroom, 1 bathroom, a living room and a kitchen.",

            "description": "Since the client had requested to maintain the existing layout of the house, the kitchen is the first room that someone meets when entering the house and, in this case, acts as the main meeting and socializing point for the family. The kitchen is partially connected with the living room where the fireplace becomes the most dominant element of the space. The materials and color palette were chosen to give to the space the feeling of warmth and comfort. Limestone render was used for the wall decoration in order to create a more earthy and tactile sensation. "

The client had requested to maintain the existing layout of the apartment, as well as preserve and integrate into the design proposal the main architectural elements such as frames, arches and cornices. The main concept behind this project was to combine modernity and classicism, austerity and colors and in this way create a dialogue between the historical traits of the apartment and contemporary design.",

Golden touches, intense velvets, warm colors, wood finishes and art pieces bring to life the most refined and elegant touch of the liberty style but at the same time create a warm, welcoming and comfortable space for the residents. Since the apartment is arranged in a series of separate rooms a different color identity was given to each one of them."

        "description": "Sitting on top of the hill above Barbati beach in Corfu, the villa looks straight out to the sea. The 3-bedroom holiday house was designed for a young couple. The aim was to merge contemporary architecture with nature and blend the building in its natural context. The restricted site boundary and the site’s inclination were the driving forces for the volumetric development of the building. By setting back the upper floor in respect to the ground floor, following the morphology of the site, the overall mass of the building is phenomenally reduced and a green roof is introduced.",

The front facade is completely glazed to take advantage of the great view towards the sea. The primary focus of the project was to combine elements, materials and textures which would create an elegant and functional space in harmony with its context. The materials and color palette were chosen in order to give to the space the feeling of warmth and comfort. Stone, wood, fabrics and metal smoothly blend together."

The aim was to achieve multifunctionality and modularity through an elegant and simple geometry, ensuring high flexibility of the interior spaces. The ground floor is composed by two separate volumes characterised by the interplay between transparent and opaque façade elements in order to meet the functional needs of each space. The pedestrian walkway that separates the two volumes is conceived as a place of passage and rest, a connection between the two sides of the university campus. ",

The first floor is designed to accommodate working spaces which are flexible and easily transformable according to the needs. The modular design makes it  easy to create numerous internal configurations offices, meeting rooms, teaching rooms and laboratories.On the top floor there is a roof garden covered by a photovoltaic pergola."
